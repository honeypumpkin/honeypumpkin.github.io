          <p>
            <br>I love to create.
            <br>I am not happy unless I have at least 10 projects going on.
            <br>It’s just how I roll.
            <br>I spend my spare time knitting, learning to code, designing, and/or planning to knit, code, design.
            <br>In “real” life, I am a graphic designer and typesetter, most recently working in the marketing sector.
            <br>...and developing my coding skills.
            <br>I have been designing and typesetting for 16 years, and it’s led me to the most amazing companies and people.
